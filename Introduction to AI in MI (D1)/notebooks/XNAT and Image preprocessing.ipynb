    "In this interactive session you will learn more about XNAT, how XNAT stores data, and how you can access and downlonad imaging data from an XNAT server. During this session we will mostly work with the central XNAT server (https://xnat.bmia.nl), but we provide future references for more advanced usecases (e.g. uploading data ot the project you have access to).\n",
    "\n",
    "XNAT offers REST API that allows its user to interact with an XNAT installation using scripts. Typically, you interact with a REST API by sending various HTTP requests: `GET` for getting data from the server, `POST` for sending any data to the server (including, for example, your login information), etc. However, this way of interaction is not optimal for research use cases. Because of that, we have built a Python wrapper for the XNAT REST API - xnatpy. If you would like to know more about how the library works you can open xnatpy [official documentation](https://xnat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
